# Statistics-and-Machine-Learning-Theory
Theory and resources of statistics required for Machine Learning

## Development Stage

1. [Statistics for Machine learning Part-1, Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/harshjain123/statistics-for-data-science-part-1)
2. [Statistics for Machine Learning Part-2, Kaglle](https://www.kaggle.com/harshjain123/statistics-for-data-science-part-2)
3. [Machine Learning Cheatsheet for Interviews](https://www.kaggle.com/getting-started/244885) : pdf uploaded 
4. [Feature Engineering Theoretical](https://www.kaggle.com/harshjain123/feature-engineering-from-scratch) : might be useful depending on the situation
5. [Time Series ARIMA Model, Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/prashant111/arima-model-for-time-series-forecasting) and [Time Series Analysis, Theory and Basics](https://www.kaggle.com/prashant111/complete-guide-on-time-series-analysis-in-python)


## LSTM, Basics and Depth
1. [Difference between Batch and Epoch](https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-between-a-batch-and-an-epoch/)
2. [Dropout for Regularizing Neural Networks](https://machinelearningmastery.com/dropout-for-regularizing-deep-neural-networks/)
3. [Choosing the right parameters for LSTM model](https://towardsdatascience.com/choosing-the-right-hyperparameters-for-a-simple-lstm-using-keras-f8e9ed76f046)
4. [LSTM - 1](http://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf) - still need to go through this and check if it's worth reading
5. [LSTM - 2](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) - still need to check if it's worth reading
6. [Activation Functions Available](https://towardsdatascience.com/activation-functions-neural-networks-1cbd9f8d91d6)
